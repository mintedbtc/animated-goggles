According to a Facebook message posted Tuesday, Apple Blossom Brewing Co. will close its restaurant at 1550 E. Zion Rd on Saturday, April 22, and Flyway Brewing will soon move in.  Apple Blossom was the brainchild of Smoke &amp; Barrel Tavern founders Evan McDonald, Sammie Stephenson, Joe Utsch and Al Schaffer, along with brewery partners Ching Mong and Daniel Smith. The partners opened the brewery and restaurant in January 2013 before closing in June of 2020 due to the pandemic.

The Kim-Cheese Pizza, made with in-house kimchi, and the fall-off-the-bone Strawberry Gochujang Ribs were phenomenal. After dinner, we satisfied our sweet tooth with a Yuzu Cheesecake Popsicle.</li><li><strong>On the record</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CpktxkwOL3p/?utm_source=NWA_Daily\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pinky Swear</a> exclusively plays vinyl records on a stereo, and even the menu is styled after a record sleeve with many of the cocktail names paying tribute to hit songs. We'd recommend the Snoop Lion, Byrhh Mama, or Latchkey Kid.</li></ul><p>No reservations needed. Pinky Swear will be open Wed-Thurs, 5-10p, and Fri-Sat, 5-11p or later.

Despite a major setback in March 2020 due to COVID-19 complications, Coleman and his team began to make ice cream in October 2020. </div></li><li><div>In the first three months of business, Simple + Sweet donated 10,000+ meals to the <a title=\"https://www.nwafoodbank.org/\" href=\"https://www.nwafoodbank.org/\">Northwest Arkansas Food Bank</a>. For each pint of ice cream sold, over 50 percent of the profit is contributed to fighting child hunger in NWA.  “It couldn’t have worked out better,” Warren said. “It allows us to represent a lot of things: being safe in a pandemic and supporting small businesses.” </div></li><li><div>Simple + Sweet sources local ingredients like honey, dairy, and chocolate from <a title=\"https://www.kyyachocolate.com/\" href=\"https://www.kyyachocolate.com/\">KYYA</a> in Bentonville and <a title=\"https://onf.coop/\" href=\"https://onf.coop/\">Ozark Natural Foods</a> in Fayetteville to make their superior ice cream. </div><div> </div><div></div></li><li><div><strong>What makes ice cream super-premium? </strong>While most ice cream contains only 10 percent butter (the fatty part of milk), Simple + Sweet&#39;s ice cream contains about 14 percent. They also only use all-natural ingredients and are made small-batch. To go even further, Simple + Sweet hand delivers their products to ensure satisfaction. </div></li><li><div>“I want people to know when they are buying this ice cream that they are helping people,&quot; Warren said.

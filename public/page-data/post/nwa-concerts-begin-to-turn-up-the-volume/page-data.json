While we&#39;re not out of the woods just yet, rumor has it that concerts are making a cautious return to NWA. At the beginning of the pandemic, <a title=\"https://georgesmajesticlounge.com/\" href=\"https://georgesmajesticlounge.com/\">George’s Majestic Lounge</a> closed for 140 days. Then, slowly, outdoor venues opened up and larger crowds began to fill seats. </p><p></p><ul><li><div>“2021 is not back to normal... Everything we’re doing is outdoor, and small capacity.

At George’s, that might mean an artist will perform two nights at half capacity. For example, the <a title=\"https://www.delmccouryband.com/\" href=\"https://www.delmccouryband.com/\">Del McCoury Band</a> will be headlining two consecutive nights instead of one larger show for Roots Festival.</div></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><div>“Everybody is trying to move forward, but they are moving at a pace that’s appropriate for their city, county and state,” said local music producer Brian Crowne. -<a title=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/25/from-zero-to-something-concerts-are-cautiously-returning-to-northwest-arkansas/\" href=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/25/from-zero-to-something-concerts-are-cautiously-returning-to-northwest-arkansas/\">Fayetteville Flyer</a></div><div><a title=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/25/from-zero-to-something-concerts-are-cautiously-returning-to-northwest-arkansas/\" href=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/25/from-zero-to-something-concerts-are-cautiously-returning-to-northwest-arkansas/\"></a> </div></li></ul><p></p><p>For a full list of 2021 concert lineups for the Roots Festival, Walmart AMP, and George&#39;s Majestic Lounge, visit <a title=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/25/from-zero-to-something-concerts-are-cautiously-returning-to-northwest-arkansas/\" href=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/25/from-zero-to-something-concerts-are-cautiously-returning-to-northwest-arkansas/\">HERE</a>. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"nwa-concerts-begin-to-turn-up-the-volume"}},

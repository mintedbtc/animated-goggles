Leverett Ave</a> will soon be a new outdoor restaurant and beer garden!&nbsp;</p><ul><li class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Foods galore: </strong>The Fayetteville restaurant will be called City Park, and there will be 3-4 types of food coming out of the kitchen. Right now, the business partners are thinking Texas-style barbecue, smash burgers, street tacos, and healthy trailside snacks. There will also be room for food trucks to park on big Razorback weekends.&nbsp;</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>On the trail: </strong>Much of the budget is going toward landscaping to pretty up the place and provide shade trees, and shipping containers will be added to provide bar and storage space. The idea is to create an outdoor space with easy access to the trail system, adding a stop between Dickson St and Lake Fayetteville. An access bridge across Skull Creek is in the works.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Read the full Fayetteville Flyer story <a href=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2022/07/07/city-park-outdoor-restaurant-and-beer-garden-coming-to-fayetteville/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.&nbsp;</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"new-outdoor-restaurant-underway-in-fayetteville"}},

These changes will include four new ballfields, additional parking, concession restroom building and other related improvements. The city estimates the project will take around 15 months to complete and is funded through the 2019 park bond approved by Fayetteville voters. -<a title=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/10/construction-begins-on-second-phase-of-work-at-kessler-mountain-regional-park-in-fayetteville/\" href=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/10/construction-begins-on-second-phase-of-work-at-kessler-mountain-regional-park-in-fayetteville/\">City of Fayetteville</a></p><p></p><ul><li><div> <strong>Did you know?</strong> Kessler Mountain is also a nature preserve.

The mountain&#39;s natural-surface trails span around 13 miles and are great for hikes, biking, or trail running. The new trails incorporate portions of these original trails, but also include beginner and intermediate-level loops for less-experienced mountain bikers. </div></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><div>If you plan on visiting Kessler beware that the popular trailhead in the baseball field parking lot is closed. Visitors can access the trail using the Fayetteville Traverse Trail (located by the playground) which will provide access to several areas of the mountain. An alternative access point can be found near the southeast corner of the soccer fields across the park road. -<a title=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/10/construction-begins-on-second-phase-of-work-at-kessler-mountain-regional-park-in-fayetteville/\" href=\"https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2021/03/10/construction-begins-on-second-phase-of-work-at-kessler-mountain-regional-park-in-fayetteville/\">Fayetteville Flyer </a></div></li></ul><p></p><p><em>Kessler Mountain Park is located at 2600 W.

NWA Daily's Disc Golf Course Guide will give you some direction on where to go sling some plastic around Bentonville, Rogers, Springdale and Fayetteville. ","content":"<p>Over the last decade, disc golf has rapidly grown in popularity both for recreation and as a highly competitive pro sport. NW Arkansas is home to some great disc golf courses, some often hosting nationally sanctioned PDGA tournaments. Whether you‚Äôre an aspiring pro or completely new to the sport, here‚Äôs a guide to some of the NWA‚Äôs best disc golf courses from north to south.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong class=\"ql-size-large\">Best Scenery: Branchwood Park in Bella Vista&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-size-small\">üìç222 Glasgow Rd, Bella Vista, AR</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/branchwood_15063ce487.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em class=\"ql-size-small\">Photo courtesy of Bella Vista POA</em></p><p><a href=\"https://bellavistapoa.com/thingstodo/recreation/disc-golf/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 161, 13);\">Branchwood</a> takes the cake on most scenic disc golf course around NW Arkansas. With 18 holes along the beautiful Branchwood Nature Trail, this course was built on an old ball golf course and has some fun holes over the rolling greens. It‚Äôs especially beautiful in the spring time.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>18 holes</li><li>DISCatcher Pro Targets</li><li>Concrete Tees</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong class=\"ql-size-large\">Best For Variety: Twin Creek in Rogers</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-size-small\">üìç2300 S Dixieland Rd, Rogers, AR</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Path_1_23de59b320.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em class=\"ql-size-small\">Photo courtesy of The City of Rogers</em></p><p>Located next to Rogers High School, <a href=\"https://udisc.com/courses/twin-creeks-cIN0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 161, 13);\">Twin Creek</a> is a long, moderately difficult course with a good amount of variety for mixed skill levels. There‚Äôs been construction in and around the course the last few years that has made the layout a bit confusing, but it received improved signage and new tees in the spring of 2022 that has helped a lot!&nbsp;</p><ul><li>18 holes</li><li>Veteran &amp; Monkey Trap Targets</li><li>Concrete, Grass Tees</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong class=\"ql-size-large\">Overall Nicest: J.

Beast</a> is a fantastic 18-hole course with consistently well-kept grass, long fairways, and a few challengers through the woods. There‚Äôs a great <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dynamicdiscsnwa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dynamic Discs</a> shop on the property and a 9-hole junior course next door. There's currently a new 18-hole course being planned for the park property that is sure to be another top course in NWA.</p><ul><li>18 holes</li><li>DISCatcher Pro Targets</li><li>Concrete Tees&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong class=\"ql-size-large\">Most Classic: North Shore in Springdale</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-size-small\">üìç1153 Lake Fayetteville Rd, Springdale, AR</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Document_5582590be6.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em class=\"ql-size-small\">Photo courtesy of Fayetteville Parks &amp; Recreation </em></p><p>One of the oldest courses in NWA, <a href=\"https://udisc.com/courses/northshore-90e8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 161, 13);\">North Shore</a> offers a great mix of open and wooded holes around beautiful Lake Fayetteville. The pins alternate seasonally, providing a little bit of variety. The grass is maintained less frequently and can get a little tall in the summer and the fields can be pretty swampy for a few days after a rain, but everyone ought to play it. It feels like the area‚Äôs O.G. course.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>18 holes</li><li>DISCatcher Pro Targets</li><li>Concrete Tees&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong class=\"ql-size-large\">Most Infuriating: Waxhaws in Fayetteville&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-size-small\">üìç855 S Block Ave, Fayetteville, AR</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Document_1_fed2107ccd.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em class=\"ql-size-small\">Photo courtesy of Fayetteville Parks &amp; Recreation</em></p><p>Folks either love it or absolutely hate it, but you‚Äôve got to appreciate a challenge. <a href=\"https://udisc.com/courses/waxhaws-ssVU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 161, 13);\">Waxhaws</a> at Walker Park is probably the most tightly wooded course in NWA with hardly any open fairways. So if you‚Äôre not accurate, you‚Äôll be kicking off trees all day, and it can stay fairly muddy for a while after it rains because it is so shaded. Almost guaranteed to get you heated, this is still a must-play course and can be really fun with the right group.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>18 holes&nbsp;</li><li>Titan Pro-24 Targets&nbsp;</li><li>Concrete Tees</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong class=\"ql-size-large\">Best Challenge: Creekside in Farmington</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span class=\"ql-size-small\">üìç54 N Hunter St, Farmington, AR&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2022_11_09_at_11_11_46_PM_0f65fe6b13.png\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of City of Farmington </em></p><p>One of the more challenging courses, <a href=\"https://udisc.com/courses/creekside-dgc-ACFi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 161, 13);\">Creekside</a> has a few holes with some&nbsp;serious distance, though there‚Äôs an alternate layout with shorter tees. This course has well-kept open fairways and a few densely wooded challenges. This course brings a consistent challenge for seasoned players, but is still fun and accessible for newcomers!&nbsp;</p><ul><li>18 holes</li><li>Veteran Targets</li><li>Concrete Tees&nbsp;</li></ul>","slug":"nwa-daily-s-disc-golf-course-guide","publishedAt":"2022-11-09"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"nwa-daily-s-disc-golf-course-guide"}},

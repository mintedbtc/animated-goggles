Emotional and mental health is top of mind right now for many people and is an essential part of the well-rounded nature of a healthy community.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/pexels_tirachard_kumtanom_347134_839ca58e99.jpg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Tirachard Kumtanom</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">While new initiatives are happening, there are already several organizations in NWA for counseling and therapy of all kinds. One of the hardest things sometimes, we think, is how many options there are. So the team at NWA Daily has done some research to narrow down 13 counseling options in the region to create a resource for your mental and emotional health journey. </span></p><p><em><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/pexels_alex_green_5699431_aeeb2c5ee8.jpg\"></em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Alex Green</em></p><p>In order by location:</p><p><span class=\"ql-size-large\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">1. </span><a href=\"https://pca-nwa.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ql-size-large\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Psychology and Counseling Associates</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Psychology+and+Counseling+Associates/@36.0976376,-94.159664,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x87c96eaebda48fcd:0xa849b8240b89f49d!4m5!3m4!1s0x87c96eaebdf608b9:0xfb1bee34bb65d3d8!8m2!3d36.0976333!4d-94.1574753\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">1 W.

Even if it’s as brief a moment as one second, people notice and almost ubiquitously harbor some fascination with flying objects in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/unnamed2_09c6e229b4.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Carol Zoch</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">It seems like such a distant place — the sky — but it really is more approachable than people realize. The Wright Brothers saw to that with their first flight in 1903. Aviation has come such a long way in just over a century, as now, flying is something anyone can do with training and help from local flight schools.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Northwest Arkansas is slowly becoming one of the hottest spots for aviation in the United States – specifically recreational aviation, because of its accessibility and the ideal environment that this part of the country provides. Recreational aviation, or backcountry aviation, has put NWA and the Ozarks on the map for many pilots, almost exclusively due to the initiative at Fly Oz, the region’s recreational aviation arm based in Bentonville.&nbsp;</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/247294321_1955533321272774_3168692070760849363_n_e3b35ce025.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Fly Oz</em>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Fly Oz and aviation enthusiasts in this part of the country have worked with private land owners to connect pilots and non-pilots to activities and experiences through a network of grass airstrips on land otherwise unreachable. Director of Fly Oz, Chip Gibbons, said people who come to fly in NWA have a bigger picture of the region than those who come mountain bike in the area for a week, which makes sense. Through initiatives to get people in the air and to different parts of the region and state, NWA has become a base in a network of adventure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“Here, our focus has really been on what you do once you have arrived,” Gibbons said. “Get out of the airplane, take in the scenery, do some fishing, do some paddling, you know, whatever lights you up.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Flying in and out of the backcountry is what the region is primarily known for in the world of aviation, but it also has the ideal infrastructure for learning to fly at any level and in any air space. Due to the lower density altitude here allowing airplanes to perform better, and the local flight schools being some of the most resourceful and approachable around, there aren’t many places better than NWA to learn to fly for fun.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“It’s almost the perfect little environment to do this in,” Gibbons said. “I don’t know what I would change about where we live that would make it better.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The two leading flight schools in the area are Summit Aviation in Bentonville and ARH Aviation in Springdale. Summit Aviation is the fixed-based operator at Thaden Field, a municipal and private jet airport in downtown Bentonville. ARH Aviation is a premier aviation supplier located at the Springdale municipal general aviation airport. Whether you train through Summit Aviation, participate in its OZ1 Flying Club department or learn to fly with experts at ARH Aviation, the sky is yours to conquer.

The center is 220.000 square feet of space, deemed as a destination for growth. Bernice Jones, a driving force in the region, gifted the center to Springdale 25 years ago with the promise that “All are welcome.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The center is a recreation, education, and event center founded with a mission to strengthen and enrich the community, celebrate culture, and be a conduit for service and thriving collaboration. The vision for The Jones Center has always been that the community would be a part of it and make it their own.

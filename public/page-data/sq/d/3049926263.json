Even if it’s as brief a moment as one second, people notice and almost ubiquitously harbor some fascination with flying objects in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/unnamed2_09c6e229b4.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Carol Zoch</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">It seems like such a distant place — the sky — but it really is more approachable than people realize. The Wright Brothers saw to that with their first flight in 1903. Aviation has come such a long way in just over a century, as now, flying is something anyone can do with training and help from local flight schools.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Northwest Arkansas is slowly becoming one of the hottest spots for aviation in the United States – specifically recreational aviation, because of its accessibility and the ideal environment that this part of the country provides. Recreational aviation, or backcountry aviation, has put NWA and the Ozarks on the map for many pilots, almost exclusively due to the initiative at Fly Oz, the region’s recreational aviation arm based in Bentonville.&nbsp;</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/247294321_1955533321272774_3168692070760849363_n_e3b35ce025.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Fly Oz</em>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Fly Oz and aviation enthusiasts in this part of the country have worked with private land owners to connect pilots and non-pilots to activities and experiences through a network of grass airstrips on land otherwise unreachable. Director of Fly Oz, Chip Gibbons, said people who come to fly in NWA have a bigger picture of the region than those who come mountain bike in the area for a week, which makes sense. Through initiatives to get people in the air and to different parts of the region and state, NWA has become a base in a network of adventure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“Here, our focus has really been on what you do once you have arrived,” Gibbons said. “Get out of the airplane, take in the scenery, do some fishing, do some paddling, you know, whatever lights you up.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Flying in and out of the backcountry is what the region is primarily known for in the world of aviation, but it also has the ideal infrastructure for learning to fly at any level and in any air space. Due to the lower density altitude here allowing airplanes to perform better, and the local flight schools being some of the most resourceful and approachable around, there aren’t many places better than NWA to learn to fly for fun.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“It’s almost the perfect little environment to do this in,” Gibbons said. “I don’t know what I would change about where we live that would make it better.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The two leading flight schools in the area are Summit Aviation in Bentonville and ARH Aviation in Springdale. Summit Aviation is the fixed-based operator at Thaden Field, a municipal and private jet airport in downtown Bentonville. ARH Aviation is a premier aviation supplier located at the Springdale municipal general aviation airport. Whether you train through Summit Aviation, participate in its OZ1 Flying Club department or learn to fly with experts at ARH Aviation, the sky is yours to conquer. Our region is yours to behold like never before.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/unnamed_49d9c760a2.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Carol Zoch</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Chad Cox, the president of Summit Aviation, told Talk Business &amp; Politics that Flying in NWA “isn’t just about getting from Point A to Point B.” It’s also about connecting to what’s happening in all the areas of recreation and leisure in NWA, adding to the overall adventure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Fly Oz and Fly AHR offer discovery flights and charter flights of different kinds for you to see and explore the beauty of our region in a whole new way. The scenic flights are also perfect for trying out how it feels to be in the sky. Like so many in recent years, who knows, you might immediately decide that becoming a pilot is for you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Becoming a private pilot through Summit Aviation in Bentonville or ARH Aviation in Springdale costs in the ballpark of $10,000 after you purchase course materials, pay for exam fees, aircraft rental, and ground and air instruction. Though it’s a bit pricey, there are </span><a href=\"https://scholarships360.org/scholarships/aviation-scholarships/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">scholarships</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\"> out there to help.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Whether you have a desire to become a pilot or not, there is a whole perspective of our region from the sky just waiting for you.

A project is brewing to “elevate The Jones Center’s core indoor recreation amenities with sustainability in mind while complimenting and blending with the Springdale Downtown Revitalization Master Plan.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">﻿</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Jones_Campus_Lawn_b872e67063.jpg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Right now, the Jones Campus includes The Jones Center and the Center for</span><a href=\"https://www.cfnjtlshop.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.cfnjtlshop.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;\">Non-Profit @ the JTL Shops</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">. The Jones Center has amenities such as an ice arena, pools, fitness center, gymnasium, runway bike park, and more. The Non-Profit @ the JTL Shops is home to more than 40 nonprofit organizations serving NWA, professional office and meeting space, and the Harvey Jones Education Building.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Jones_Center_Runway_OZ_Sports_66a4acb9f7.jpg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The vision for the campus consists of bold changes that include introducing new open spaces and plazas, incorporating art pieces that pique interest and act as culturally inspired place-makers, and creating an interconnected system of hard and soft surface trails that tie The Jones Campus to downtown and beyond. The vision has a multi-layered approach with theme-based programming. The themes are wellness and recreation, gardens and ecology, community and gathering, arts and culture, and campus support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Jones_Center_Playground_fd5029fccc.jpg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The project’s goals include creating another destination in NWA where people gather, “recreate, celebrate, and build a stronger sense of community,” expanding on Bernice’s ethos of welcoming all.

Construction on the Cultural Arts Corridor or, The Ramble, is currently underway with efforts to advance the city’s ecological and elemental care with sustainable means and ends, said Peter Nierengarten, the City’s Environmental Director and The Ramble’s project manager. The Ramble will be the city’s first large urban park, and though it will be similar to other parks in the U.S., The Ramble will stand out as a result of its attention to the surrounding environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Ramble_Civic_Space_2_87a8c2b8e1.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“It’s got a really strong focus on sustainability, low impact development, stormwater, and native ecology,” Nierengarten said. “And I think that will set it apart.”The Ramble will be the first in Arkansas to be a certified SITES project. The certification, according to </span><a href=\"https://sustainablesites.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">The Sustainable SITES Initiative</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">, determines that a landscape project helps “reduce water demand, filter and reduce stormwater runoff, provide wildlife habitat, reduce energy consumption, improve air quality, improve human health, and increase outdoor recreation opportunities.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Ramble_RG_7e1010dd64.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The Ramble will check all of these boxes and more as it moves along toward completion. The new outdoor public space will not only provide spaces for native plant species and stormwater storage, but it will provide opportunities for anyone and everyone who wants to come and celebrate arts and culture or enjoy recreational activities or events. Nierengarten said, The Ramble will be a flexible space for programming that could be used for anything from small-scale events to a 2,500+ person festival.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“The park will have space for downtown events including concerts and performances or festivals, starts and finishes for bicycle and running races, and everything in between,” Nierengarten said, “including when it’s not a programmed activity.”</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The primary elements of The Ramble are the Fay Jones Woods, the Razorback Greenway, new streetscapes on West Avenue, a new parking deck on the corner of West and Dickson streets, and a new Civic Space on West Avenue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Ramble_Parking_Deck_c93a7ac335.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">﻿</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Ramble_sidewalk_and_wall_cbd50332bd.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The improvements to the Fay Jones Woods will include the restoration of Tanglewood Branch Creek, which will be accessible to the public, providing a spot for cooling off in the hot summer months. There will also be new trails in the forest, gathering spaces, informal paths, and a boardwalk. The West Avenue Civic Plaza will feature a central lawn, promenade, art gardens, trails, and two buildings on the north and south ends that will be developed through public-private partnerships.

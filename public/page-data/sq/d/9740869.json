Recreational aviation, or backcountry aviation, has put NWA and the Ozarks on the map for many pilots, almost exclusively due to the initiative at Fly Oz, the region’s recreational aviation arm based in Bentonville.&nbsp;</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/247294321_1955533321272774_3168692070760849363_n_e3b35ce025.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Fly Oz</em>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Fly Oz and aviation enthusiasts in this part of the country have worked with private land owners to connect pilots and non-pilots to activities and experiences through a network of grass airstrips on land otherwise unreachable. Director of Fly Oz, Chip Gibbons, said people who come to fly in NWA have a bigger picture of the region than those who come mountain bike in the area for a week, which makes sense. Through initiatives to get people in the air and to different parts of the region and state, NWA has become a base in a network of adventure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“Here, our focus has really been on what you do once you have arrived,” Gibbons said. “Get out of the airplane, take in the scenery, do some fishing, do some paddling, you know, whatever lights you up.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Flying in and out of the backcountry is what the region is primarily known for in the world of aviation, but it also has the ideal infrastructure for learning to fly at any level and in any air space. Due to the lower density altitude here allowing airplanes to perform better, and the local flight schools being some of the most resourceful and approachable around, there aren’t many places better than NWA to learn to fly for fun.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“It’s almost the perfect little environment to do this in,” Gibbons said. “I don’t know what I would change about where we live that would make it better.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The two leading flight schools in the area are Summit Aviation in Bentonville and ARH Aviation in Springdale. Summit Aviation is the fixed-based operator at Thaden Field, a municipal and private jet airport in downtown Bentonville. ARH Aviation is a premier aviation supplier located at the Springdale municipal general aviation airport. Whether you train through Summit Aviation, participate in its OZ1 Flying Club department or learn to fly with experts at ARH Aviation, the sky is yours to conquer. Our region is yours to behold like never before.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/unnamed_49d9c760a2.jpeg\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Photo courtesy of Carol Zoch</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Chad Cox, the president of Summit Aviation, told Talk Business &amp; Politics that Flying in NWA “isn’t just about getting from Point A to Point B.” It’s also about connecting to what’s happening in all the areas of recreation and leisure in NWA, adding to the overall adventure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Fly Oz and Fly AHR offer discovery flights and charter flights of different kinds for you to see and explore the beauty of our region in a whole new way. The scenic flights are also perfect for trying out how it feels to be in the sky. Like so many in recent years, who knows, you might immediately decide that becoming a pilot is for you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Becoming a private pilot through Summit Aviation in Bentonville or ARH Aviation in Springdale costs in the ballpark of $10,000 after you purchase course materials, pay for exam fees, aircraft rental, and ground and air instruction. Though it’s a bit pricey, there are </span><a href=\"https://scholarships360.org/scholarships/aviation-scholarships/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">scholarships</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\"> out there to help.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">Whether you have a desire to become a pilot or not, there is a whole perspective of our region from the sky just waiting for you.

Construction on the Cultural Arts Corridor or, The Ramble, is currently underway with efforts to advance the city’s ecological and elemental care with sustainable means and ends, said Peter Nierengarten, the City’s Environmental Director and The Ramble’s project manager. The Ramble will be the city’s first large urban park, and though it will be similar to other parks in the U.S., The Ramble will stand out as a result of its attention to the surrounding environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Ramble_Civic_Space_2_87a8c2b8e1.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“It’s got a really strong focus on sustainability, low impact development, stormwater, and native ecology,” Nierengarten said. “And I think that will set it apart.”The Ramble will be the first in Arkansas to be a certified SITES project.

The new outdoor public space will not only provide spaces for native plant species and stormwater storage, but it will provide opportunities for anyone and everyone who wants to come and celebrate arts and culture or enjoy recreational activities or events. Nierengarten said, The Ramble will be a flexible space for programming that could be used for anything from small-scale events to a 2,500+ person festival.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">“The park will have space for downtown events including concerts and performances or festivals, starts and finishes for bicycle and running races, and everything in between,” Nierengarten said, “including when it’s not a programmed activity.”</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The primary elements of The Ramble are the Fay Jones Woods, the Razorback Greenway, new streetscapes on West Avenue, a new parking deck on the corner of West and Dickson streets, and a new Civic Space on West Avenue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Ramble_Parking_Deck_c93a7ac335.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">﻿</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Ramble_sidewalk_and_wall_cbd50332bd.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(31, 32, 33);\">The improvements to the Fay Jones Woods will include the restoration of Tanglewood Branch Creek, which will be accessible to the public, providing a spot for cooling off in the hot summer months.

The first floor will be open to the public and have retail shops and a coffee shop for the community and visitors to enjoy. The building is specifically designed, however, for patrons to engage in innovation and profitable productivity, Sarah Day, Ledger Marketing and Small Business Sales Lead, said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Ledger_8bb787ab32.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">“We say it all the time, this isn’t a silo,” Day said. “We don’t want people to stay in this building and never go explore downtown.”</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Ledger is intended to be an extension of the downtown experience.

There will be 150 hand-tiled mosaic bugs ranging from 4ft to 7ft long, making them hard to miss. They will be depicted as heading toward the top of Ledger to collectively, with their gems, create something bigger than themselves, which is “an ethos for the building, for the community, for Northwest Arkansas,” Best said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">﻿</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Ledger_8b9acede5a.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Like the Ozark bugs carrying their gems, the people of NWA make this region a better place together.

Over the last five years, the Canopy team and the community have helped integrate 380 people in Northwest Arkansas. Of those 380 people, 187 came to Canopy in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">In August 2021, an Islamic fundamentalist group called the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan after 20 years, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Afghans looking to flee. The U.S. infrastructure for resettling refugees was not in a position to resettle so many people all at once, but agencies like Canopy and the surrounding communities made a seemingly impossible feat possible.&nbsp;“People stepped up like crazy,” Canopy team member Nellie Beall said. “Especially in the last four to five months, we could not have done it without the NWA community.”</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Canopy_1_2cca290448.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Since the start of the U.S. refugee resettlement program in 1980, the number of refugees allowed in the country had been on a general decline, save for a spike after the collapse of the Soviet Union. So when the refugee admittance ceiling was at a record low of 15,000 in 2020, the country became almost desolate of official organizations open for resettling evacuees.“Canopy was one of the only refugee settlement agencies, of this small of a magnitude, that even survived the four years of low refugees coming in,” Beall said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">After the Taliban regained power in August, with hundreds of refugee assistance programs having closed, and even more having made severe cuts, congressional offices morphed into makeshift agencies and informal operations centers. Nonprofits and charities sprang to action, and old resettlement agencies hired people as fast as they could. The staff at Canopy doubled in the span of a few months, reaching a representation of 12 countries including Afghanistan.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">\"So we’re talking about also training, onboarding people while navigating a crisis, while regular refugees were also being served,” Beall said. “​​Meanwhile also carrying the grief of our colleagues that were Afghans. They were seeing their home country crumble to the hands of the Taliban.” Before the refugee cap was raised in May, the Canopy team was taking in approximately one family a month. As more refugees were allowed to come to the U.S. in mid-summer, one family a month turned into one family a week. The team at Canopy had already turned up the volume on operations when over 100 people needed to be resettled as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Swarms of volunteers made themselves available to assist in any way they could, putting together care packages and donating affordable living spaces, furniture, and funds. About 300 people signed up to be co-sponsors at Canopy, who dedicate six months to walk alongside new families as they integrate into the region.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Canopy_2_a8c838806e.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Canopy clients coming from Afghanistan were considered humanitarian parolees by the U.S. government, which was an obstacle at the beginning of Canopy’s journey. Humanitarian parolees are only granted temporary refuge and are not allowed services refugees are, such as access to food, medical, or cash assistance. But in October, Congress passed legislation to give all the public benefits allotted to refugees to the Afghans who came in as a parolee, and Afghan Placement Assistance later organized for the Afghans to become green card holders after seeking asylum status.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">While Canopy staff worked tirelessly to organize benefits and acquire accommodations for hundreds of new neighbors, the Canopy co-sponsors took on the role of welcomers and family advocates.&nbsp;Denise Karnes, a member of a co-sponsor team since September, said the role of co-sponsor has put her and her team in a position to empower the Afghan families in simple ways, “like teaching them how the bus system works.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Karnes and her co-sponsor team have been walking with an Afghan family since October. The family has now met a community full of people who have skills and a desire to contribute to a friendly integration process and make it as smooth as possible.&nbsp;“So many people in our community are willing to come on board and make that happen,” Karnes said, referencing personal contacts, one of whom is an English As A Second Language teacher coordinator, and the other, a reading specialist.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Beall said the endless hours of work the team at Canopy has given and continues to give are offered with the sincere mission to provide safety and wellness to a growing diverse community. As an immigrant herself, Beall said she knows what it is like to not have an agency help her navigate the transition to America, so getting to be the help she didn’t have is worth every minute.&nbsp;“A lot of people don’t know that the average time for refugees to stay in a [refugee] camp is 18-26 years,” Beall said. “So seeing someone rebuild their lives and settle in this quickly in comparison, how could you walk away from this job? This work?”</span></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/Canopy_3_184c607584.jpeg\"></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The number of Afghans Canopy assured the government it could house when the Afghan crisis happened will have been met by the end of this month. Since September, a number of afghans have taken up residence in Fayetteville, Springdale, and Bentonville. There is still work to be done, as Afghans and other refugees are still arriving and learning what it is to be here. Volunteers are always put to work at Canopy, and affordable housing is always needed, but upholding a standard of a welcoming community is more important than ever.</span></p><p><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">About Canopy NWA</strong></p><p>Our mission is to create a community where refugees are welcomed and equipped with all they need to build new lives.

Amanda knew that the approach to wellness could be simplified - and so could her mindset.</p><p>“I realized that I am the steward of my body, I get to take care of it, and my body does so much for me and was created in an incredible way. And if I steward my body well, I will feel better from the inside out, and therefore, be able to show up better in all areas of my life,” Wilson said.</p><p>Another shift came when she began staying home after the birth of her first son. Amanda was inspired to share easy, yet nutritious and fueling meals with her Instagram audience. In order to avoid overloading family and friends, she took a chance and created a separate account to post meals and workouts there.</p><p>Amanda started posting a little over five years ago with the goal and intention of sharing how wellness can be simplified, stewarded well, and to help others find freedom and joy in their wellness journey. Since then, she has amassed over 14,000 followers on Instagram and authored wellness workout plans, food preparation guides and kid’s lunch box plans.</p><p>“I love using this space to equip and encourage others to steward their wellness journey in a sustainable way with intention and joy while navigating each season of life… I find a lot of joy and celebrate in seeing how others’ approach to wellness has simplified and transformed through the years,” she said.</p><p><em><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f2750b_45bac10383f74fc89da7a8e1a1b2059c_mv2_aea3e2891b.webp\"></em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Photo Courtesy of </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/awilsonwellness/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>@awilsonwellness</em></a><em> on Instagram﻿</em></p><p><a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/fattest-cities-in-america/10532\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><strong>A recent study by Wallethub</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;ranked Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers No. 15 for most obese/overweight adults per capita in the US. The Little Rock-NLR area placed 4th. The study also ranked cities based upon their access to healthy food and fitness resources, in which both Arkansas cities ranked poorly. Does this surprise you at all?</strong></p><p>It’s sad to see that statistic, but not out of shame or judgement to anyone at all, but to the lack of education and access to healthy food and fitness resources across the board. Unfortunately, that’s due to the way our country has changed the way food is produced, provided, and over time has changed the mindset toward food in general.</p><p>The general approach to food is to eat what’s convenient, tastes good, and fulfill a hunger desire, without thought to the fact that food does something inside your body once consumed other than just make you full.</p><p>Education and simplifying the approach to the fact that it comes down to real food and movement, I believe, can transform that statistic as people feel empowered as stewards of their body. Unfortunately, it’s so hard to do when you have millions of messages from unrealistic diets, methods of eating, and a list of do’s and don’ts that are constantly at conflict.</p><p><strong>Sadly too, access to real foods can be scarce for many, whether that’s due to a financial situation or actual access to a store with fresh food.

The latter can be a slightly painful part of the process, because we all want transformation right away, but it will result in sustainable and attainable results.</li><li>Before you dive into a specific way of eating, I encourage you to just focus on learning to prepare and cook real food.

We want to establish a healthy relationship with nourishing our body and not let our foundation be dependent on specific restrictions. We want to feel empowered and enjoyment in fueling our bodies well in order for it to be sustainable.</li><li>When it comes to working out, shift your focus to just moving your body in some way.

Simple + Sweet ice cream is infused with about 14 percent butterfat. In other words, this is the creamiest, stretchiest, most mouthwatering ice cream in the world.</p><p>Additionally, they only use all-natural ingredients such as lavender water extract and fresh strawberries to limit the amount of artificial sweeteners in the products. This creates an optimal experience for customers who are more sensitive to headaches associated with artificial sweeteners.</p><p>Most importantly, the ice cream is made extremely “small-batch”- four gallons at a time to be exact. This allows for less air in the product, leading to a richer taste. For comparison, some generic brands are also considered small-batch, yet produce 22 gallons at a time.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><span style=\"color: rgb(60, 72, 88);\"><img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f2750b_0b578bfd0a5b419cb44620b599590aae~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_687,h_696,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f2750b_0b578bfd0a5b419cb44620b599590aae~mv2.webp\" width=\"100%\"></span><em>Photo Courtesy of&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/simplesweetcreamery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(48, 119, 101);\"><em>@simplesweetcreamery</em></a><em>&nbsp;on Instagram</em></p><p>And the quality doesn’t end there.

For 24-year-old KK Hudson, the constant longing to be on a beach somewhere preceded this year-long pandemic, and created a unique opportunity to supply an endless amount of smiles for NWA locals.</p><p><strong>Like clockwork.</strong>&nbsp;KK and her mom, Carrie, migrated from their home in Dallas, Texas, to Laguna Beach, California, in search of salty air and sunshine every summer. Their days were filled with endless laughter, perfect waves, and delicious acai (ah-sah-ee) bowls. For those who have yet to get their hands on one, an acai bowl is essentially a thick, creamy smoothie topped with superfood nutrients like fruit, granola, seeds, and honey.</p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f2750b_eff7b88623ca462fa7d4a9f291f9e693_mv2_2b3d575133.webp\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Photo Courtesy of&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mamakabowls/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(48, 119, 101);\"><em>@mamakabowls</em></a><em>&nbsp;on Instagram</em></p><p>That fall, both KK and Carrie realized they couldn’t wait nine more months to taste another bowl. Soon after, Carrie created the most decadent acai bowl known to man, and began delivering them to KK’s high school. Following months of hard work and a permanent granola smell in their home, Carrie decided to put away the blender - at least for a while.</p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f2750b_695fd803414c4ea7962d7f6dafbad9e0_mv2_2637758b7e.webp\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Carrie Hudson, Photo Courtesy of&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mamakabowls/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(48, 119, 101);\"><em>@mamakabowls</em></a><em>&nbsp;on Instagram</em></p><p>During her junior year at the University of Arkansas, KK took a leap of faith and launched a website for friends to order acai bowls and pick them up at her house in Fayetteville.</p><p>“I expected my customers to mainly be my friends who felt like being nice to me that day, but it completely took off,” Hudson said. \"After that summer, my mom and I came together and knew Mamaka was bigger than just ourselves and the household operations we had started.”</p><p>Construction began on Mamaka Bowl’s first location during KK’s last semester of college. She kept her class load light and her vision strong.</p><p>“We were super naïve jumping into the whole process (which I fully believe was a blessing) and built out most of the space ourselves,” she said. “We were doing what we have always dreamed of and were excited by the learning curves that kept coming and continue to come our way.”</p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f2750b_b849821206334da1a54cf864b469e105_mv2_5a6f800a63.webp\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>KK Hudson (right) and Carrie Hudson (left), at Mamaka's Fort-Worth location.

Did you find living in Fayetteville to be particularly nurturing for a business owner, specifically when securing a physical space for the restaurant?</strong></p><p>Yes absolutely! Again, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into when we opened and the community of Fayetteville totally rallied around us. Other businesses in the community were excited about helping promote who we were, and our customers immediately showed an immense amount of kindness, encouragement and support. I could go on and on about how much I love Fayetteville!</p><p><strong>Between larger metropolitan areas like Waco and DFW, do you see any similarities or differences when compared to Fayetteville? Would it have been more difficult to start somewhere like Dallas as opposed to Arkansas?</strong></p><p>I think each location has its own challenges. We are big on believing that everything happens for a reason and God opens and closes the right doors… Fayetteville has such an incredible culture of people who lift each other up and I think that’s probably invaluable. We are super excited about being in the DFW area because it’s where I grew up and it’s where my mom started the whole story of Mamaka!</p><h2>“We were doing what we have always dreamed of and were excited by the learning curves that kept coming and continue to come our way.”</h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>KK at Mamaka Bowl's Fayetteville Location Photo Courtesy of&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mamakabowls/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(48, 119, 101);\"><em>@mamakabowls</em></a><em>&nbsp;on Instagram</em></p><p>Recent research at the U of A found that entrepreneurship in Northwest Arkansas is on the rise, even amid the pandemic.

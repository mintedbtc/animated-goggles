Espalier is fundamentally a formal training style for fruit trees but because the basic materials are living woody trees, there are almost as many patterns and forms as there are espalier plants. The form a gardener chooses can be as rigid and formal or as whimsical and fantastical as you wish. The bonus is that you can greatly improve the quality of your fruit harvest and your landscape by training fruit trees to grow in flat forms. You will learn what fruit trees and varieties work best with this gardening technique and the does and don’ts. In depth espalier concepts will be discussed with hands-on demonstration in the garden on a Arkansas Black apple tree.

Hayes’ success continues to transcend genres, with the release of a new version of current single “Y’all Life” featuring R&amp;B/pop superstar&nbsp;Ciara.

Their eighth full-length, the aptly titled&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">8</em>&nbsp;[Island Records], proudly upholds that tradition for the quintet—Brandon Boyd [vocals], Mike Einziger [guitar, piano, backing vocals], José Pasillas II [drums], Chris Kilmore [turntables, keyboards], and Ben Kenney [bass].</p><p>“As a band, we’re collectively interested in challenging ourselves and hopefully finding new, innovative ways of writing music,” asserts Boyd. “That ethos has kept things interesting for us.”</p><p>It’s also kept things interesting for listeners everywhere. By 2017, the band’s sales exceeded 23 million worldwide, while landing four Top 5 debuts on the&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Billboard</em>&nbsp;Top 200 and one #1 album. They’ve graced the stages of festivals everywhere from&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Lollapalooza</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Air + Style</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Download Festival</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Pinkpop</em>&nbsp;in addition to touring alongside the likes of Linkin Park, OutKast, Moby, Jane’s Addiction, Queens of the Stone Age, and many more. After the release of 2015’s&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Trust Fall (Side A)</em>&nbsp;EP and a packed summer amphitheater tour with Deftones, the boys once again treaded uncharted territory. They collaborated with a dynamic talent behind the board as&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">8</em>&nbsp;would be co-produced and mixed by Skrillex [Justin Bieber, A$AP Rocky, Lady Gaga]. In January 2016, Boyd and Einziger holed up in a Venice Beach shack, building “Much of the musical framework in a weird man cave,” laughs Boyd.</p><p>By fall, the five musicians regrouped to flesh out ideas, recording at Jim Henson Studios and at Einziger’s personal studio. As the vision came into focus during early 2017, Incubus added another level by enlisting the perspective of longtime friend Skrillex for co-production and mixing. Einziger had spent the past few years, exponentially expanding his personal musical palette. Not only did he oversee production for The Internet’s&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Feel Good</em>&nbsp;and produce three songs for Tyler, The Creator’s chart-topping “Cherry Bomb,” but he also co-wrote Avicii’s six-times platinum smash “Wake Me Up” and served as musical director and performer for a much talked-about 2016 GRAMMY® Awards performance of “Where Are Ü Now” by Skrillex, Diplo, and Justin Bieber. After lunch one day, Einziger played Skrillex some mixes, and “a whole new world opened up” as the producer added his magic to&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">8</em>.</p><p>“It evolved organically out of my friendship with Skrillex,” Einziger elaborates. “Incubus is all about friendship. We transferred the synergy of working together into what the band was doing. As we put the final touches on everything, Skrillex brought another level to the album.”</p><p>As a result, the eleven tracks comprising&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">8</em>&nbsp;assemble a mosaic reflective of the band’s current mindset. Unease translates to unpredictable guitar riffs that blur the lines between time signatures as cosmic rhythmic transmissions orbit around an epicenter of combustible emotion. Each lyric encodes a parable or what might be a hidden message. The first single “Nimble Bastard” leapfrogs from a rattling guitar snap into an anthemic refrain. “Loneliest” echoes with an existential rumination on solitude over an airy beat and hypnotic guitars. “Undefeated” struts along via a bombastic stomp before culminating on an uplifting chant, while the spacey “Familiar Faces” instantly enchants.</p><p>The soothing instrumental soundscape of “Make No Sound In The Digital Forest” illuminates their cinematic side with delicate chimes, simmering drums, and warbling tones. A dial-up modem signals the explosion of “Love In A Time of Surveillance” as the one-two punch of “No Fun” and “Throw Out The Map” tap into a tsunami of distortion and punk-y freedom. “Glitterbomb” represents the glorious push-and-pull of&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">8</em>, teetering between heavenly harmony and a dramatic twinge.</p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">8</em>&nbsp;arrives at a significant milestone for Incubus—releasing exactly 20 years since their major label debut&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&nbsp;</em>landed back in 1997. A little older, a lot wiser, quite tighter, but equally ready to challenge themselves and rock music at large, Incubus change their perspective once more in 2017.</p><p>“All the time, I hear from fans that our music was the backdrop of their first experience with love or important in getting them through a hard time,” says Einziger. “That’s the highest compliment.”</p><p>“When we finished&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">8</em>, we were flooded with this wave of gratitude,” Boyd leaves off. “The fact that so many people are willing to come on this weird ride with us is really humbling. We’re filled with this sense of awe around it. We’re very happy to share this record with everyone, and we hope they like it.”</p><p>For the last 20 years,&nbsp;<strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Coheed and Cambria</strong>&nbsp;have continuously broken the mold of what a rock band can be, forging their own path and building a universe around their music unlike any other. Whether it is in the way their genre-spanning approach to songwriting has allowed them to bridge worlds without being contained to one, or the multifaceted story arc of their albums and comic book series which mark the longest running concept story in music, Coheed and Cambria have consistently shaped new standards, never conformed. Comprised of Claudio Sanchez (Vocals / Guitar), Travis Stever (Guitar), Josh Eppard (Drums) and Zach Cooper (Bass) the band has gripped listeners and press around the globe with their visionary compositions and conceptual mastery. In 2018,&nbsp;Coheed&nbsp;and Cambria made a stunning debut with their album&nbsp;<em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Vaxis I: The Unheavenly Creatures</em>, which debuted at #1 on Billboard’s “Hard Rock Albums” chart, #6 current sales and Top 15 on the “Billboard 200” chart.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Learn more </span><a href=\"https://waltonartscenter.org/AMP/upcoming-concerts/incubus/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">here</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">.</span></p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span class=\"ql-cursor\">﻿</span>Presented by Walmart AMP in partnership with Live Nation.</em></p>","name":"Incubus with Coheed & Cambria","type":"Music","date":"2023-05-27","eventLink":"https://waltonartscenter.org/AMP/upcoming-concerts/incubus/","photo":{"publicURL":"/static/a9d63b01152c31c155db06f7ffc48e80/8c03117ae4842d583200703aa03a3839.jpg"},"location":"Walmart AMP | Rogers, AR","organization":"Walmart AMP"}},{"node":{"strapiId":340,"slug":"siloam-springs-fourth-friday-at-memorial-park","published_at":"2023-05-23T14:59:35.445Z","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/featured-stories/siloam-springs-to-host-its-first-ever-fourth-friday-event/?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;fbclid=IwAR0YfTU8-gbltiAwYIS0wIP9I3Yy5rm-FuK8-mkyycILJrsNri8RzuFbtGM&amp;mibextid=ncKXMA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Siloam Springs</a> will host its first-ever <a href=\"https://discoversiloam.com/events/may-fourth-friday/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fourth Friday</a> community event at Memorial Park on May 26, from 4-8:30p, and the theme is Americana!</p><ul><li><strong>Best summer ever</strong>: The monthly family-friendly event will transform downtown into one big block party complete with free activities, bounce houses, <a href=\"https://discoversiloam.com/events/may-fourth-friday/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">over 40 local vendors</a>, live music, and much more!&nbsp;Food trucks and vendors will open at 4p.</li><li><strong>Memorial</strong>: In observation of <a href=\"https://discoversiloam.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Memorial Day Weekend</a>, this first Fourth Friday will honor our nation’s Armed Forces with a special ceremony at 6:30p at the Chautauqua Amphitheater, followed by musical artist <a href=\"https://discoversiloam.com/events/the-shannon-wurst-band/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Wurst</a> who will kick-off the Summer Concert Series at 7p.</li></ul><p>Find more information and see the entire season's schedule <a href=\"https://discoversiloam.com/?utm_source=NWA_Daily\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.</p>","name":"Siloam Springs Fourth Friday at Memorial Park ","type":"Event","date":"2023-05-27","eventLink":"https://discoversiloam.com/events/may-fourth-friday/","photo":null,"location":"Siloam Springs","organization":"Discover Siloam Springs"}},{"node":{"strapiId":337,"slug":"johnson-square-summer-series-kick-off","published_at":"2023-05-22T19:25:15.284Z","description":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.johnsonsquare.com/?utm_source=NWA_Daily\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Johnson Square Summer Series</a> kicks off this Friday, May 27, filling the streets with games, giveaways, and live music from 6-9p.</p><ul><li><strong>Mic'd up</strong>: The summer series will take place every fourth Friday from May until Aug, featuring a great lineup of local and regional artists like <a href=\"http://www.smokeyandthemirror.com/?utm_source=NWA_Daily\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Smokey &amp;

Calling All PIGS! June 3 is the 9th&nbsp;annual Pig Trail Mud Run. If you think getting wet and dirty sounds fun, and you love to be mentally and physically challenged, then the Pig Trail Mud Run is the race for you! Plan to stick around afterward for more fun. You can pig out on food and cold drinks and enjoy some great entertainment at the recovery picnic. Even if you don’t like the idea of running the race yourself, come out and join the picnic anyway. The race starts and ends at Ecclesia College and is run in an undeveloped, rustic area of Northwest Arkansas. Located in the beautiful Arkansas Ozarks, the course features extreme hills, underbrush and lots of trees, a stream bed and ponds. That’s before you factor in the ultra-challenging obstacles, you’ll have to navigate to complete this 5K race. You may even see a wild boar. Bring your piglets to this year’s race and let them wallow and play in the mud while you run. Kids ages 4 through 10 are invited to play in the mud, squirt each other with water, and do a number of other fun, muddy activities.</span></p>","name":"Pig Trail Mud Run","type":null,"date":"2023-06-03","eventLink":"https://pigtrailmudrun.org/","photo":null,"location":"Ecclesia College, 9653 Nations Dr., Springdale","organization":"Springdale Rotary Club"}},{"node":{"strapiId":331,"slug":"garden-gate-tour","published_at":"2023-05-04T18:52:50.424Z","description":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(49, 49, 49);\">Tickets are now on sale for&nbsp;the \"Garden Gate\" tour,&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(49, 49, 49);\">Saturday, June 3, 9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.,</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(49, 49, 49);\">&nbsp;sponsored by the Washington County Master Gardeners.

Members of the public are cordially invited and encouraged to attend.&nbsp; The event is ARRL Field Day (www.arrl.org/FieldDay), an annual amateur radio activity organized since 1933 by ARRL, The National Association for Amateur Radio in the United States.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Hams from across North America ordinarily participate in Field Day by establishing temporary ham radio stations in public locations to demonstrate their skill and service. Their use of radio signals, which reach beyond borders, bring people together while providing essential communication in the service of communities. Field Day highlights ham radio’s ability to work reliably under any conditions from almost any location and create an independent, wireless communications network.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Some hams from the ARRL Arkansas Section will also use the radio stations set up in their homes or taken to their backyards and other locations to operate individually or with their families. Many hams have portable radio communication capability that includes alternative energy sources such as generators, solar panels, and batteries to power their equipment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">This year's event is also noteworthy given that a particularly active hurricane season is predicted. “Hams have a long history of serving our communities when storms or other disasters damage critical communication infrastructure, including cell towers,” said Tom Northfell W5XNA - Bella Vista Area Radio Club Field Day Coordinator. “Ham radio functions completely independently of the internet and phone systems and a station can be set up almost anywhere in minutes. Hams can quickly raise a wire antenna in a tree or on a mast, connect it to a radio and power source, and communicate effectively with others,” Northfell added.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">During Field Day 2021, more than 26,000 hams participated from thousands of locations across North America. According to ARRL, there are more than 750,000 amateur radio licensees in the US, and an estimated 3 million worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Among the tenets of the Amateur Radio Service is developing and practicing skills in radio technology and radio communications, and even contributing to international goodwill. Hams range in age from as young as 9 to older than 100. A self-study license guide is available from ARRL: The ARRL Ham Radio License Manual (www.arrl.org/shop/Ham-Radio-License-Manual) and for Kindle (https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07DFSW94G). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For more information about ARRL Field Day and ham radio, visit the Bella Vista Area Radio Club website bellavistaradioclub.org and www.arrl.org/what-is-ham-radio.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","name":"The American Radio Relay League Annual Field Day","type":"Event","date":"2023-06-25","eventLink":"https://bellavistaradioclub.org/event/field-day/","photo":null,"location":"Bella Vista ","organization":"Bella Vista Radio Club"}},{"node":{"strapiId":360,"slug":"movement-class-at-the-mount-sequoyah","published_at":"2023-05-23T16:43:28.963Z","description":"<p><em>*This week's Movement Class will be at Mount Sequoyah as part of the </em><a href=\"https://www.fayettevillemovementfestival.com/?utm_source=NWA_Daily\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fayetteville Movement Festival</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><br></p><p>Find community while pursuing fitness goals by joining <a href=\"https://movementclass.univer.se/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Movement Class</a> at the ArtCourt on Dickson&nbsp;in Fayetteville, led by movement coach <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/philipmoves/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Shepherd</a> every Saturday at 10:30a from May 6 - Sep 23.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Let’s get moving</strong>: Movement Classes include exercise drills intended to improve joint health and range of motion while building full-body strength and coordination through fun, interactive, and accessible workouts.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>All together now</strong>: Community is key to reaching fitness goals no matter where you’re starting your journey.

Her grandmother and parents convinced her to put her Andy Warhol inspired sunflower pastel drawing into the County Fair Art Show. She won a blue ribbon. Her love for art only grew stronger. After graduating high school, she attended Bethany College as an art major. During the first semester, her grandfather was diagnosed with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer. Amy’s passion was put to the side as she dedicated time to</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">help care for her family. This heartbreaking time made Amy want to change career paths and transfer schools to obtain her Bachelors of Science in Nursing.&nbsp;After five years of working as a pediatric nurse, Amy started painting again. Her show “Joy” in the spring of 2017 was held in Connecticut for two months. She has also had local showings throughout Northwest&nbsp;Arkansas. She has been a vendor at several NWA markets; The Little Craft Show, Fifth Market, and Sleet City Market to name a few. Amy will be a vendor at the three day event, The Smoky Hill River Festival, in her hometown of Salina, Kansas, which has always been a dream of hers. She was also selected to have two pieces curated in America’s first ever Biennial Art and Fashion show, Assembly, in Springdale, Arkansas during June 2023. Beginning this fall, Amy will be the featured artist at The Apollo on Emma in Springdale, Arkansas.&nbsp;Amy currently resides in Fayetteville, Arkansas with her husband Thomas and their three children, Ayla, Luke and Alec, and their dog Ellie. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Learn more </span><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/art-installation-meet-greet-tickets-699828013427?utm_source=eventbrite&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=post_publish&amp;utm_content=shortLinkNewEmail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">HERE</a><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">. </span></p>","name":"CONNECTION - An Art Installation by Artist Amy Rimmer","type":"Event","date":"2023-09-28","eventLink":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/art-installation-meet-greet-tickets-699828013427?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=post_publish&utm_content=shortLinkNewEmail","photo":null,"location":"Springdale","organization":"The Apollo on Emma"}},{"node":{"strapiId":507,"slug":"drive-electric-nwa","published_at":"2023-09-09T22:28:30.498Z","description":"<p>Drive Electric NWA highlights electric cars and e-bikes and the increasingly important role they play in Northwest Arkansas transportation.

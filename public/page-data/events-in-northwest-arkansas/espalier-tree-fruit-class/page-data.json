Espalier is fundamentally a formal training style for fruit trees but because the basic materials are living woody trees, there are almost as many patterns and forms as there are espalier plants. The form a gardener chooses can be as rigid and formal or as whimsical and fantastical as you wish. The bonus is that you can greatly improve the quality of your fruit harvest and your landscape by training fruit trees to grow in flat forms. You will learn what fruit trees and varieties work best with this gardening technique and the does and donâ€™ts. In depth espalier concepts will be discussed with hands-on demonstration in the garden on a Arkansas Black apple tree. You will walk away with a good understanding of what it takes to establish your own backyard espaliered fruit tree.</span></p><p>$15/members or $25/nonmembers</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"espalier-tree-fruit-class"}},

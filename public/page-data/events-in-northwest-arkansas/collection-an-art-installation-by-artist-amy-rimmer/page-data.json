Her grandmother and parents convinced her to put her Andy Warhol inspired sunflower pastel drawing into the County Fair Art Show. She won a blue ribbon. Her love for art only grew stronger. After graduating high school, she attended Bethany College as an art major. During the first semester, her grandfather was diagnosed with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer. Amy’s passion was put to the side as she dedicated time to</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">help care for her family. This heartbreaking time made Amy want to change career paths and transfer schools to obtain her Bachelors of Science in Nursing.&nbsp;After five years of working as a pediatric nurse, Amy started painting again. Her show “Joy” in the spring of 2017 was held in Connecticut for two months. She has also had local showings throughout Northwest&nbsp;Arkansas. She has been a vendor at several NWA markets; The Little Craft Show, Fifth Market, and Sleet City Market to name a few. Amy will be a vendor at the three day event, The Smoky Hill River Festival, in her hometown of Salina, Kansas, which has always been a dream of hers. She was also selected to have two pieces curated in America’s first ever Biennial Art and Fashion show, Assembly, in Springdale, Arkansas during June 2023. Beginning this fall, Amy will be the featured artist at The Apollo on Emma in Springdale, Arkansas.&nbsp;Amy currently resides in Fayetteville, Arkansas with her husband Thomas and their three children, Ayla, Luke and Alec, and their dog Ellie. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Learn more </span><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/art-installation-meet-greet-tickets-699828013427?utm_source=eventbrite&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=post_publish&amp;utm_content=shortLinkNewEmail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">HERE</a><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">. </span></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"collection-an-art-installation-by-artist-amy-rimmer"}},

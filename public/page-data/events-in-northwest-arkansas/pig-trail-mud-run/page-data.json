Calling All PIGS! June 3 is the 9th&nbsp;annual Pig Trail Mud Run. If you think getting wet and dirty sounds fun, and you love to be mentally and physically challenged, then the Pig Trail Mud Run is the race for you! Plan to stick around afterward for more fun. You can pig out on food and cold drinks and enjoy some great entertainment at the recovery picnic. Even if you don’t like the idea of running the race yourself, come out and join the picnic anyway. The race starts and ends at Ecclesia College and is run in an undeveloped, rustic area of Northwest Arkansas. Located in the beautiful Arkansas Ozarks, the course features extreme hills, underbrush and lots of trees, a stream bed and ponds. That’s before you factor in the ultra-challenging obstacles, you’ll have to navigate to complete this 5K race. You may even see a wild boar. Bring your piglets to this year’s race and let them wallow and play in the mud while you run. Kids ages 4 through 10 are invited to play in the mud, squirt each other with water, and do a number of other fun, muddy activities.</span></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pig-trail-mud-run"}},

Our team and company have grown at an incredible pace, and to continue this growth, we must do so intentionally. We have very high expectations for ourselves, each other, and every new team member. We’re looking for high performers who go about their work with a sense of curiosity and a drive to make things better.

United States farmland has historically outperformed most asset classes and other forms of real estate. Unfortunately, buying and maintaining farmland directly is extremely difficult without local knowledge and management, as well as large investment commitments. AcreTrader solves these issues by providing transparency, flexibility, and ease of use to people wanting to invest in farmland while handling all aspects of administration and property management, from insurance and accounting to working with local farmers and improving soil sustainability. At the same time, AcreTrader works to help farmers scale through innovative sales and leasing opportunities. See our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.acretrader.com/resources/how-it-works\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--stormGrey);\"><strong>How it Works</strong></a>&nbsp;page for more details.</p><p><strong>AcrePro</strong>, the brokerage arm of AcreTrader, provides best-in-class land valuation, sales, development, and conservation expertise to its customers. At the core of AcrePro is a highly qualified team, combining decades of experience in financial services and agriculture alongside millions of dollars in transactions. Our simple mission is to create a faster, more transparent way for buyers and sellers to transact in the world of farmland. AcrePro’s offerings include investing, land management, appraisal, auctions, diligence and evaluation, financing, land and resource conservation, and more.</p><h3><strong>AcreMaps</strong>&nbsp;aims to be the most comprehensive, accurate, and useful mapping tool for agriculture. There are over 50 million farmland owners in the world that require a better service to explore their land. That includes using satellite imagery to discover how land has evolved, pricing land at market values through valuation algorithms, and exploring many layers of underlying agronomic information. Our team solves complex computer science problems, designs beautiful and intuitive product experiences, and improves the accuracy of our data to set the industry standard for mapping.&nbsp;</h3>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ux-researcher-acretrader"}},

United States farmland has historically outperformed most asset classes and other forms of real estate. Unfortunately, buying and maintaining farmland directly is extremely difficult without local knowledge and management, as well as large investment commitments. AcreTrader solves these issues by providing transparency, flexibility, and ease of use to people wanting to invest in farmland while handling all aspects of administration and property management, from insurance and accounting to working with local farmers and improving soil sustainability. At the same time, AcreTrader works to help farmers scale through innovative sales and leasing opportunities.

Our simple mission is to create a faster, more transparent way for buyers and sellers to transact in the world of farmland. AcrePro’s offerings include investing, land management, appraisal, auctions, diligence and evaluation, financing, land and resource conservation, and more.</p><p><strong>AcreMaps</strong>&nbsp;aims to be the most comprehensive, accurate, and useful mapping tool for agriculture. There are over 50 million farmland owners in the world that require a better service to explore their land. That includes using satellite imagery to discover how land has evolved, pricing land at market values through valuation algorithms, and exploring many layers of underlying agronomic information. Our team solves complex computer science problems, designs beautiful and intuitive product experiences, and improves the accuracy of our data to set the industry standard for mapping.&nbsp;</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"acretrader-senior-manager-fp-and-a"}},

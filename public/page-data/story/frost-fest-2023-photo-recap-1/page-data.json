Local artisans and businesses came to the event to connect with the public and display their products and services, and rocking out on stage were The Phlegms, Vintage Pistol, and Nick Shoulders &amp; Okay Crawdad.</p><p>Beyond enjoying great beer and local businesses, it was a blast getting to see friends from all over Northwest Arkansas gathering to raise a glass to good times and great beer with big smiles on their faces.</p><p>Great work Fossil Cove.

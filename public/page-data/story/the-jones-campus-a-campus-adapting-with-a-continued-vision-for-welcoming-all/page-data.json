The center is 220.000 square feet of space, deemed as a destination for growth. Bernice Jones, a driving force in the region, gifted the center to Springdale 25 years ago with the promise that “All are welcome.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The center is a recreation, education, and event center founded with a mission to strengthen and enrich the community, celebrate culture, and be a conduit for service and thriving collaboration. The vision for The Jones Center has always been that the community would be a part of it and make it their own. And with people doing just that, the center is continuously growing and adapting to the ever-changing region.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The Jones Center and its 52-acre campus are currently in a phase of re-imagining. A project is brewing to “elevate The Jones Center’s core indoor recreation amenities with sustainability in mind while complimenting and blending with the Springdale Downtown Revitalization Master Plan.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">﻿</span><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Jones_Campus_Lawn_b872e67063.jpg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Right now, the Jones Campus includes The Jones Center and the Center for</span><a href=\"https://www.cfnjtlshop.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.cfnjtlshop.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;\">Non-Profit @ the JTL Shops</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">. The Jones Center has amenities such as an ice arena, pools, fitness center, gymnasium, runway bike park, and more. The Non-Profit @ the JTL Shops is home to more than 40 nonprofit organizations serving NWA, professional office and meeting space, and the Harvey Jones Education Building.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Jones_Center_Runway_OZ_Sports_66a4acb9f7.jpg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The vision for the campus consists of bold changes that include introducing new open spaces and plazas, incorporating art pieces that pique interest and act as culturally inspired place-makers, and creating an interconnected system of hard and soft surface trails that tie The Jones Campus to downtown and beyond. The vision has a multi-layered approach with theme-based programming. The themes are wellness and recreation, gardens and ecology, community and gathering, arts and culture, and campus support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://nwa-daily-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Jones_Center_Playground_fd5029fccc.jpg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">The project’s goals include creating another destination in NWA where people gather, “recreate, celebrate, and build a stronger sense of community,” expanding on Bernice’s ethos of welcoming all. The design elements of the project include the Meto Spine, Emma Ave. Connector + JTL Courtyard, The Community Common, OZ Play Area, Fitness Pad, OZ Gardens + Expanded Action Sports, and Woven Links + Patchwork Parking + JTL Plaza.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Click </span><a href=\"https://jonescampusvision.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;\">HERE</a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> to learn all about it.&nbsp;</span></p>","slug":"the-jones-campus-a-campus-adapting-with-a-continued-vision-for-welcoming-all","image":{"publicURL":"/static/50ee6cfb2ade6f51c1946062d8ba1104/747ff5548ed4f979009cb55f1a814c10.jpg"},"publishedAt":"2022-05-31T17:00:00.000Z","author":{"name":"Gael Langdon"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-jones-campus-a-campus-adapting-with-a-continued-vision-for-welcoming-all"}},

I firmly believe, and the quality of the innovation that is being investigated in our program confirms, that this lack of representation is not because their innovative ideas are irrelevant to SBIR/STTR support. I am thrilled to be working with each participant as they create their own journey in developing their innovation and I am beaming over the potential that this type of support will not only have on each participants’ life but for the overall growth in our state.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(52, 51, 47); background-color: transparent;\">About Startup Junkie:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 51, 47); background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;Located in Fayetteville, Startup Junkie is building entrepreneurial ecosystems in Northwest Arkansas through providing no-cost, one-on-one consulting; events, workshops, and programs; and access to capital and talent.</span></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(52, 51, 47); background-color: transparent;\">About Science Venture Studio:</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 51, 47); background-color: transparent;\"> Supported by the Walton Family Foundation, the Science Venture Studio in collaboration with Innovate Arkansas, the Northwest Arkansas Council, University of Arkansas Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Startup Junkie aims to help Arkansas science- and technology-based startups apply for non-dilutive federal funding.

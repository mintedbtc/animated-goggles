The mountain&#39;s natural-surface trails span around 13 miles and are great for hikes, biking, or trail running. The new trails incorporate portions of these original trails, but also include beginner and intermediate-level loops for less-experienced mountain bikers. </div></li></ul><p></p><ul><li><div>If you plan on visiting Kessler beware that the popular trailhead in the baseball field parking lot is closed.

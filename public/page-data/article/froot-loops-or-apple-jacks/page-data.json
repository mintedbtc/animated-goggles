According to a Facebook message posted Tuesday, Apple Blossom Brewing Co. will close its restaurant at 1550 E. Zion Rd on Saturday, April 22, and Flyway Brewing will soon move in.  Apple Blossom was the brainchild of Smoke &amp; Barrel Tavern founders Evan McDonald, Sammie Stephenson, Joe Utsch and Al Schaffer, along with brewery partners Ching Mong and Daniel Smith. The partners opened the brewery and restaurant in January 2013 before closing in June of 2020 due to the pandemic.  The restaurant reopened under new owner Tony Trammel and family in February of 2021.  Flyway Brewing opened in North Little Rock’s Argenta Arts District in 2015. The brewery offers a variety of styles, including a blonde ale, brown ale, pale ale, an IPA, stouts, and others along with seasonal brews like an pumpkin IPA, Oktoberfest, and others according to their website.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Blossom</a> opened in 2013 and won over the area with delicious eats like the ABBC Burger and Fayettedaze Beer Cheese-loaded fries.
